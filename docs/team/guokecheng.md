### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target
users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload
among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual
tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads,
allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner. The app also automates the process of planning 
and communicating with subordinates, making it easier for managers to get things done. Additionally, the app ensures
that emails are sent during working hours, so that subordinates will not be disturbed outside of work.
