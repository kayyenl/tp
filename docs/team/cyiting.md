### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel 
at companies. The target users are managers who are responsible for assigning tasks and 
overseeing the work of a team.

OfficeConnect provides managers a convenient way to manage their subordinates as it gives 
managers an overview of their subordinates contacts and their teams  as well as track tasks 
that the subordinates are responsible for completing.

Through OfficeConnect, managers can also plan deadlines, delegate tasks and automate sending 
mass emails.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
