### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads, allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner. The app also automates the process of planning and communicating with subordinates, making it easier for managers to get things done. Additionally, the app ensures that emails are sent during working hours, so that subordinates will not be disturbed outside of work.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Local Storage for OfficeConnect.
  * What it does: With this new feature, users can now save OfficeConnect data to a local file, enabling them to easily restore their data from local storage.
  * Justification: The addition of Local Storage is a crucial enhancement for OfficeConnect. It provides users with a convenient and reliable way to store their data, which can be easily accessed and restored as needed. This feature ensures that users have complete control over their data, helping to improve productivity and streamline workflows.
  * Highlights: The addition of Local Storage is a significant update that impacts the existing data structure of OfficeConnect. This feature is a fundamental building block for all other OfficeConnect features, making it a key component of the software's architecture. With Local Storage, OfficeConnect provides a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing data, enabling users to work more efficiently and effectively.
